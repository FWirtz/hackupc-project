## About
Staying on top of your business trips is pretty hard:

> Where did I leave the boarding pass again?
> Did I book my flight yet?

**TravelTimmy** takes the strain out of travelling for business.
Ask Timmy to get you a quote for the flight to your next destination. Rest assured that you get access to the cheapest flights, thanks to the [Skyscanner](https://skyscanner.com) API. <br>
Like the flight? Book it instantly via their platform and lean back - Timmy takes care of your ticket as well and has it ready when you need it. All of that from the comfort of your favourite communication tool [Twist](https://twistapp.com).
